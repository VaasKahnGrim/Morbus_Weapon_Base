# Morbus_Weapon_Base
A weapon base specifically designed for morbus gamemode. Its was originally a modified version of M9K that was outdated. Now much more organized and efficient.
This weapon base will eventually be populated with additional features, improvements and performance enhancements as time goes on so that servers actually have a proper weapon base to use.

It will even support SWEP Construction Kit, you know....if you use that thing.
